This project revolves around Workforce Overview in a mid-sized company. To analyze the data advanced SQL formulas (MySQL) were used, together with Google Dashboard for visualizations as well as a written report with the insights from analysis and recommendations for the future. 

As the source data a sample open-source database from SQL Tutorial https://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-correlated-subquery/ was used. This database was created for the purpouse of SQL open tutorial, yet it was chosen to use it my way from scratch.
Only few employees entry personal data were slightly modified compared to the original data, as it did not include any people employed in last 20 years. To make it more up to date few "junior positions" with respective salary and hire date were added.
