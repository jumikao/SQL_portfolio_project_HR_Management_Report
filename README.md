1. Overview

This project revolves around Workforce Overview Analysis in a mid-sized company. To analyze the data advanced SQL formulas (MySQL) were used, together with Google Dashboard for visualizations as well as a written report with the insights from analysis and recommendations for the future. 

------------------------------------------

2. Dataset

As the source data a sample open-source database from SQL Tutorial https://www.sqltutorial.org/ was used. This database was created for the sake of SQL open tutorial, yet it was chosen to be used for personal purpouses, from the scratch, taking initial structure of tables and their entries.
Only few employees' entry personal data were slightly modified in the Analysis compared to the original data, as it did not include any people employed in last 20 years. To make it more up to date few "junior positions" with respective salary and hire date were added.

This data set contains an SQL database called HR_project, which consist of 7 tables dedicated to HR data:
- The regions table: stores the data of regions such as Asia, Europe, America, and the Middle East and Africa. The countries are grouped into regions.
- The countries table: stores the data of countries where the company is doing business.
- The locations table: stores the location of the departments of the company.
- The departments table: stores department data.
- The employees table: stores the personal data of employees.
- The jobs table: stores the job data including job title and salary range.
- The dependents table: stores the employeeâ€™s dependents.

Relations between tables presents a image called "HR Department" to be found in the folder "Images".

To put it into worlds, table "employees" is linked to the tables:
- "jobs" via job_id,
- "departments" via department_id,
- "dependents" via dependent_id.
Table "departments" is linked to the table "locations" via location_id.
Table "locations" is linked to the table "countries" via country_id.
Table "countries" is linked to the table "regions" via region_id.

Key column variables in the dataset include:
- table "employees":
  - employe_id - unique employee identification number in the company
  - first_name
  - last_name
  - email
  - phone_number
  - hire_date

  - job_title
  - min_salary - also called "salary floor" as it indicates lowest possible salary range per job title
  - max_salary - also called "salary ceiling" as it indicates highest possible salary range per job title
- table "dependents":
  - dependent_id - unique dependent identification number in the company
  - first_name
  - last_name
  - relationship
  - employee_id
- table "departments":
  - department_id - unique department identification number in the company
  - department_name
  - location_id
- table "locations":
  - location_id - unique location identification number in the company
  - street_address
  - postal_code
  - city
  - state_province
  - country_id
- table "countries":
  - country_id - unique country identification number in the company
  - country_name
  - region_id
- table "regions":
  - region_id - unique region identification number in the company
  - region_name

3. Root Cause Analysis Process

- The Analysis is aimed to play an important role in the regular HR data evaluation and is presented from the perspective of an HR Management Report.
- The Analysis serves the purpouse of answering the following questions:
  - What is the distribiution of employees and employees salaries per region, country, city, department, job role?
  - How many job roles are there in the company and what are salaries linked to them?
  - Which 10 employees have maximum and minimum salaries?
  - Which employees are best paid in their departments and what is their job role?
  - Who are the employees who are paid higher salary than an average salary per region?
  - Is the seniority (length of being hired) in the company correlated with higher salary average?
  - Is the data complete (no empty cells) and errorproof?
  - Family dependants and what is their relationship with company employees?

- After conducting a check of employee actual salaries vs salaries range according to the company guidelines it was noted that no salary exceeded the maximum salary range given per job role. However, there were  two situations in which the actual salary of an employee was lower than the minimum salary range given per their job role. These two cases should be further analysed as for the reasons behind them as well as whether adjustments in the salaries of the employees should be made. The positions involved inc luded Marketing Representative and Stock Manager.
- Comparing an average salar ies in terms of seniority of employment, it was noted that the employees who have worked longer in the company tended to earn more than those with shorter seniority. Average salary  for senior worker in the company equalled to 8.877, while it was 5.529 for mid position and 3.800 per junior position. That should give a healthy attitude to seniority of employment, given the assumption that  employees who work in the company longer have more relevant work experience and capability.
- In terms of workforce demography, it would be recommended that more junior employees were recruited. Currently in the company there are 30 seniors, 7 mids and only 3 juniors.
